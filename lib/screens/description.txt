The screens directory contains all application screens grouped by the scope of the application
Etc. Login, Registration, and password recovery screens belong to the same scope (Let's call it Auth scope)
so the path to the any of mentioned screens will be screens/auth/screen_name.dart

Each screen will be placed in its own directory etc. login screen path will be 
screens/auth/login/screen_name.dart
The screen folder root file will be main screen file, in this case, login.dart
If the screen requires its own widgets, services, providers, or something else it should be placed in its own
directory.
etc. path to the private login widgets will be screens/auth/login/login_widgets/widget.dart
